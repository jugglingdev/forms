### What I learned

I really enjoyed this tutorial.  Supposedly forms are hard, but at least I find them fun to build.

The `<form>` element takes `action` and `method` attributes which define the web server's URL to process the data in the backend and how the form is submitted.  Use `method="post"` when changing data and `method="get"` when only getting data.

*Text Input Fields*
